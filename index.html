									<h3>Watercolours</h3>
									<p>Taking artists through the materials needed, providing explanations of paper choice, paints needed and brushes.</p>
									<p>We cover flat blocks of colour, how sky's, clouds, sunsets make the watercolour stand out. In no time you'll know terms like <bold>web-on-wet</bold> &amp; <bold>wet-on-dry</bold> like a master</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-pen-fancy"></span>
									<h3>Acrylics</h3>
									<p>Acrylics are fast drying paints that can be used straight from a tube, like oil paints, or can be thinned with water, like watercolour.</p>
									<p>We'll learn the methods of mixing paints, using a palette knife, glazing which is a great way to seal pencil sketches to paint over. I will show you the trickier acrylic painting techniques to master.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-palette"></span>
									<h3>Oils</h3>
									<p>I teach the methods on approaching oil painting, building depth with layers or working in one application (wet-on-web or 'alla prima').</p>
									<p>Oil paint remains wet longer than many other types of artists' materials, enabling the artist to change the color, texture or form of the figure.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-pencil-alt"></span>
									<h3>Pastel</h3>
									<p>Pastels are undoubtedly unique as a result they offer a special blend of the two most common approaches to art creation.</p>
									<p>We'll learn that the textures of paper plays a vital role in the finished appearance of your work, learning pastel texturing in layered applications. I will show you step-by-step how to blend colours and building up to create detail.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-mortar-pestle"></span>
									<h3>Pottery</h3>
									<p>This course cover a wide range of areas including using the kiln, glazing and firing, health and safety and much more. My aim is equip you with the skills and knowledge to use the materials and learn about pitfalls</p>
									<p>You will learn to throw basic cylinder forms and create your own pots. These are interactive sessions where you’ll learn hand-building techniques (pinching, slab-building, etc.) & make multiple pieces like cups/jugs/pots.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-stroopwafel"></span>
									<h3>Needle Felting</h3>
									<p>Needle felting is a method of creating felted objects without using water. The special needles used to make 3D sculpture, jewellery, adornments and 2D art have notches along the shaft of the needle that catch fibres and tangle them with other fibres to produce felt.</p>
									<p>Learning to used the special needles (also known as barbs) to craft from wool fibre - known as Stabbing Wool. You will be taught the various stabbing techniques.</p>

Some of the techniques include resists with gutta and/or wax, special effect salts and alcohol. The hand dyed silk can be used in a variety of ways such as pictures, art to wear, bags, jewellery, cushions, lampshades, scarves, ties and cards. The dyed silk can also be embellished, embroidered and quilted.</p>
